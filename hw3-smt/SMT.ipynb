    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this session is to get familiar with the ways problems can be modelled and solved using SMT solvers. We will use the Python APIs of the Z3 SMT solver(s) to model and solve problems, and we will also look at the SMT-LIB interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the notebook contains a brief overview of the Python SMT API with a lot of example code given. You will have to solve exercise with less and less help as you proceed. Look for *TODO*s in the code: you have to complete the solution at those points. If you have any technical questions or problems concerning the APIs, check the documentations and tutorials referenced at the end of this notebook. If you have any questions concerning the exercises, feel free to ask the tutors via Teams or email."

    "\n",
    "One of the first steps when interfacing SMT solvers is to declare the types (sorts) and symbols needed for modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python, we can declare variables (or constants, if you prefer) using the sort name as a constructor, or using the `Const` constructor. As a convention, the solver variable is usually assigned to a Python variable of the same name, which is later used to construct expressions. The available sorts include the ones introduced in the various SMT-LIB theories. Bit-vector variables are declared by adding the bit-width as a second argument, and arrays by adding the index and object sorts (the index is typically Int sort in a conventional array)."

    "\n",
    "Alphametics (aka cryptarithms) are arithmetic puzzles in which every letter has to be replaced by a digit, i.e., a number in the range `[0, 9]`, so that some equation is satisfied. We also require that the digits are pairwise distinct, and that the left-most digit of each term is non-zero. Alphametics can be solved easily using an SMT solver by declaring an appropriate set of variables, of sort `Int` or `BitVec`, adding the relevant constraints about digits, and stating the equation to be solved.\n",
